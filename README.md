# TicTacToe-Multiplayer-Java
Self driven project, just to try to make a multiplayer game.

To be able to play, we'll need to create a ```.jar``` file.
If using IntelliJ IDE, simply move to ```Artifacts``` tab inside ```Project Settings```, and then create a new output for a Jar file on build.
If using Eclipse, Right click the project name and press ```Export```, and move to ```Runnable JAR File``` option inside ```Java```.

Afterwards, you'll be needing to choose a path for the output file, and to include the required libraries and extract them into the generated JAR.

Once done, proceed to open 2 command lines and navigate to the path you set for the Jar file. run it with ```java -jar *JARFILENAME*.jar```.

Set the desired IP Address of your opponent and his designated port, he should do the same (if playing locally, just type 'localhost').

The game will notify you it successfully connected!
